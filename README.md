## The making of the maps and Facts

### About the map (details/facts)

For reference i'll use this link : https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/dungeons-saga-chumas-first-maps.238/

These were the first map i've ever played, as an exercise if you like play them, they are id1, no music, they were made in JACK, maybe not horrible but not good maybe (?) (the "chronological order is: Dungeoncrawl, Dungeonescape, Dungeonspeed)

So for a while i've been feeling this saga of maps never ended well, but i lost the original .map files of the originals, so no substantial improvement or change, remakes either so... why not conclude it properly?

The original maps had small parodic or "comedic" parts, secrets, even monster encounters, so i decided to import the best essence of these maps with my knowledge and practice.

I wanna thank bmFbr for helping me along the way, i did a lot but he helped me a lot in some complex parts of the map and i learned some tricks and relearned ones i knew but i forgot (my memory isn't what it used to be)

the map is on protocol 666 (for a line it hits the limit with a small brush but it's contained within the limits).

### "The Disciples of Shub Niggurath" special thanks

I have frequent people that help me on with my maps, so it is with coding projects, so i decided to make a small group list(non-related or attached) of those that help me, the intention is that it sounds like a band, so, i'll list it as it was written with some modifications (this is some sort of "wholesome meme", don't worry, just Chuma being Chuma/ myself being myself):


- Chuma (main mapper)
- Forte (Co mapper and designer, helps a lot)
- CommonCold (Co mapper and designer also Deadpool, helps a lot)
- EmeraldTiger (Co mapper and designer also a Kamen Raider, helps a lot but has a Kamen raider suit more points)
- bmFbr (Technical/Coding/design assistance , John Carmack in disguise but he denies it)
- Admer (Technical/Coding/design assistance, if bm is John Carmack, Admer is an Eldritch entity)
- Makkon (Art assistance , Adrian Carmack would be proud except he hasn't made a statue)
- MopeyBloke (Tester, he da best bug finder and feedback)
- RecycledOJ (Compatibility tester, He is the only one using Quakespasm and not the spiked one)
- Yuyi and Alunadrern (They are my best friends but they actually give me RGB values when i ask them for feedback and help (FOG and Sky values), so in theory they are the "Sun and moon" of "Chuma's Quake maps universe" {Thanks for this joke Admer}
